# Mercury-Microcosms
The script provides code to conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on potential mercury methylation rate constants (kmeth) from microcosm experiments conducted in October 2020.  There is also a script for running ANOVA on kmeth and kdemeth (potential methylmercury demethylation rate constants) from microcosm experiments conducted October 2022.

Nettie Calvin contributed to the project and can be contacted at jicalvin@ucsc.edu to provide assistance and to answer questions.
